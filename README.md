This repository is a collection of some interesting concepts and examples in the scikit learn official user guide: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html 

Content covered:
1. Linear Models --> [Generalized Linear Models, Ordinary Least Squares, Non Negative Least Square, Ridge, Lasso, Bayesian Ridge, Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression, XOR with linear classifier]
2. Bayesian Regression --> [Automatic Relevance Determination, ARD] vs [Bayesian Ridge Regression] vs [Linear Regression] 
3. Nearest Neighbors --> Unsupervised NN, KDTree and BallTree, NN Classifier, NN Regression, NN Transformers, Neighborhood Component Analysis & Pipeline, Comparing NN with and without NCA, Dimensionality Reduction with NCA (P.S. Here NN == Nearest Neighbors)
4. PCR vs PLS --> Comparing Pricipal Component Regression with Partial Least Squares method on a toy dataset example. 
5. Out-of-Core Classification [Online Learning] --> An example showing the implementation of scikit-learn for classication using out-of-core approach (learning from data that doesn't fit into main memory).
