# sklearn_docs
This repository is a collection of some interesting concepts and examples in the scikit learn official user guide: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html 

Content covered:
1. Linear Models --> [Generalized Linear Models, Ordinary Least Squares, Non Negative Least Square, Ridge, Lasso, Bayesian Ridge, Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression, XOR with linear classifier]
2. Bayesian Regression --> [Automatic Relevance Determination, ARD] vs [Bayesian Ridge Regression] vs [Linear Regression] 
3. Nearest Neighbors --> Unsupervised NN, KDTree and BallTree, NN Classifier, NN Regression, NN Transformers, Neighborhood Component Analysis & Pipeline, Comparing NN with and without NCA, Dimensionality Reduction with NCA (P.S. Here NN == Nearest Neighbors)
4. PCR vs PLS --> Comparing Pricipal Component Regression with Partial Least Squares method on a toy dataset example. 
5. Out-of-Core Classification of Text Documents --> An example showing the implementation of scikit-learn for classication using out-of-core approach (learning from data that doesn't fit into main memory) on Reuters dataset.
6. Trees --> Implementation of the sklearn decision trees classes, Classification, Regression.
7. TotallyRandomTrees --> RandomTreesEmbedding, compairing BernoulliNB with ExtraTreesClassifier.
8. Manifold Learning --> Illustrating embedding techniques(IsoMap, Locally Linear Embedding, MDS, Spectral Embedding, t-SNE) on the digits datasets.
9. Ensembles --> Bagging, Random Forest, Extermely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Histogram based Gradient Boosting, Voting, Stacking.
